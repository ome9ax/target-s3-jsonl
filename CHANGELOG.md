[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ome9ax/target-s3-jsonl/compare/0.0.4...0.0.5)

### New features:
- I now store the rows in an Array on memory, and unload the Array into the file by batches. By default the batch size is 64Mb configurable with the `memory_buffer` config option.
- I also extended the compression config option to the `lzma` compression algorithm, storing the output file under the .xz extension.
- Update the message parsing to handle the metadata through the `add_metadata_columns` config option according to the [stitch documentation](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns).
- `timezone_offset` config option added to use `utc` timestamp in the `naming_convention`
- `local` configuration option to store the data on `tmp_dir` local dir without uploading to `s3`
- More specs and tests
